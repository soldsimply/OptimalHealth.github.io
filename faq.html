			<p style="color: red; font-style: italic;">How can I expect to feel after a massage?</p>
			<p style="text-align: left;">Most people notice a decrease in muscle tension and a feeling of relaxation and well-being after receiving a massage. You may experience some soreness, especially the day after the massage, if you received Deep Tissue Massage or Trigger Point Therapy. After a few days the soreness will be replaced by an overall improvement in pain level and muscle function.</p>
			<p style="color: red; font-style: italic;">How often should I receive a massage?</p>
			<p style="text-align: left;">Muscle tension/tightness builds up over time and will eventually result in pain and/or joint dysfunction. The pain can be thought of as the tip of the iceberg. When pain is present, 1-2 massages per week will help relieve the pain. Once the pain has been resolved, a maintenance schedule of 1-2 massages per month can help keep muscle tension below the pain threshold. The effects of massage are cumulative.</p>
			<p style="text-align: left;">Since therapeutic massage is very effective for stress relief and relaxation, many clients choose to receive massages on a regular basis to decrease their stress level. The frequency ranges from one time per week to one time per month. In times of increased stress the massages can be scheduled more frequently.</p>
			<p style="text-align: left; font-style: italic;">I encourage my clients to experiment with different treatment frequencies to decide what works best for them. Although the majority of my clients receive massages on a weekly or biweekly basis, some choose to schedule a massage only 1-2 times per year as a special treat. </p>
